# Ravanello

This is the cli tool for analyze redis keys, what is very actual when you have many data in your redis.

## Installation

Just install gem to your local environment

    $ gem install ravanello

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ravanello

## Usage

```bash
FETCH_LIMIT=1000 REDIS_URL='redis://localhost/mydb' ravanello --rules rules.yml
```

You need to pass rules yml file, providing information about proposal keys structure

```yml
rules:
  resque:
    - 'delayed'
    - "resque-retry"
    - "timestamps"
    - 'lock'
    - 'meta'
  denormalization:
    - 'users'
    - 'companies'
    - 'orders'
    - 'tenders'
    - 'processed_batches'
    - 'managers'
  companies:
    - 'dummy'
```

Samples of unclassified keys will be printer after analyze, and you will be able
to add them to rules file.

The FETCH_LIMIT is not required and is used for tests runs monstry (and for grouping key)
